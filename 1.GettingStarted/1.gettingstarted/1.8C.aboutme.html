Hi Everyone. My name is Arthur Brayner and I am from Brazil. I actually live in Recife, it's a city located at the North East Area of Brazil. The weather use to be a mix of sunny and cloudy days, it looks crazy but it's a nice and amazing tropical city.

I really enjoy the privilege to be a member of the church, learning through the prophets,scripture study and applying these teachings to our daily routine help me a lot to enjoy a better life quality.

I was always passionated by foreign languages, I used to study languages like English, German and Italian and one day my friends invited me to try to study programming languages to learn how to create things like those of our favorite games, apps, websites and this is why I came here. I thought that I wouldn't be happy if I let it pass without learn how those thinks work.

Besides the course I like to take a time to study German beyond English classes but it is just when the time allows me. I also like to play sports, run and ride bike.
Thank You for visit my web page.
